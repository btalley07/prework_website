 <h2 class="p3">About Me</h2>
 <p class="p3">I'm 32 and live in Phoenix, Arizona with my boyfriend and our fur/feather babies. 
     I was previously a teacher when I left to pursue my Ph.D. only to find out that 
     people are not ready for my thoughts and opinions. So I came back to the tech world.</p>  

<p class="p3">I like to run competitively, and have gotten into powerlifting. 
    This seems contradictory (and it is) but I love them both too much. 
    I also love reading, drawing, and playing video games. </p>
<h3 class="p3"> Why am I here?</h3>
 <p class="p3">When I was in high school my cousin taught me the basics of coding and I remember 
     really enjoying it. So much so that my computer became quite a mess. After a long 
     reflection and realization that education wasn't where I needed to be anymore I 
     began the search for my place in this world. What I'm hoping to get out of this 
     is skills and direction on where I want to go from here with my career. 
     Is it really data science that I'm interested in? Only time will tell.</p>
